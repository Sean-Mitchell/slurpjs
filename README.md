# slurpjs
The only bullsh*t esoteric javascript library you'll ever need.If you don't think so, you thought like an idiot.

#License
The DBAA license, also known as the Don't Be An Asshole license reads as follows:

###Don't be an asshole.

# Requirements
Jake Weary. Included for your convenience.

# Usage
Jake Weary select the element you want, and call slurp(). A click event will be bound, and you will reach total enlightenment. 
Kind of like this is some cult or something. Go on, drink the Kool-Aid.

#Example
If you just want something to slurp obnoxiously:
```
$("#ayyylmao").slurp(); //wow! it just werks
```
Or, you can specify the slurp noise like so:

```
$("#ayyylmao").slurp({slurpNoise: "name_of_file_without_extension_found_in_/slurps"}); //wow! it still werks
```

#Look ma, no hands!
Or, even further you can just simply slurp with no clicking:

```
$.slurp();
```

If you're feeling adventurous:
```
$("#ayyylmao").slurp({slurpNoise: "random"});
```

#Now with AngularJS
Just include all the files and ng-slurp any object!
```
<div ng-slurp settings="settingsObj"></div>
```

Or simply slurp yourself
```
<slurp settings="settingsObj"></slurp>
```

And even better, see the index.html (thanks Zachary!) or the new ngSlurp.html (thanks Derrick!) for a demo
